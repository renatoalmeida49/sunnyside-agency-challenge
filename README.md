## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this challenge I think I could solidify my knowledge about background images. This is a really nice template I can reuse in other projects.  
  
And this is the first project where I try to use the CSS only in classes, not in HTML tags. This allows to build more dynamic HTML Semantic, improving the refactories in future.

### Continued development

The CSS file it's really big. I should study how to use the @import, at least to put the media queries in other files. Also use SASS.

### Useful resources

- [The use of cite and blockquote tags](https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/textlevel-semantics.html#the-cite-element) - This was the first project where I used this tags. It's a better markup and semantic for HTML.
